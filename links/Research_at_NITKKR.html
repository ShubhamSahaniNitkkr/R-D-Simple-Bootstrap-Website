    <strong><div class="panel-heading"></strong>Research at Faculty level</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Research at faculty level addresses a variety of exciting problems, attempting to provide solutions that are different from what has been proposed earlier and offers counter-intuitive insights that will challenge established viewpoints. Not only does our research make significant advancements to existing body of knowledge but also enriches the classroom experience which will enhance the teaching-learning process. Thus, members of faculty at NITKKR undertake research on a wide range of topics and these research endeavors are funded either internally   (scheme: Seed Grant for newly joined faculty) or by external sources such as the Government of India and other funding bodies. Thus, the members of faculty promote and deeply involved in their own independent research in their respective discipline as well as interdisciplinary domains. This activity in the Institute brings up its intellectual base.</div>

    <strong><div class="panel-heading"></strong>Research at Students level</div>
    <div class="panel-body">NITKKR provides a wide breadth of research opportunities for our talented students to discover something special in their respective field and take advantage of the facilities and infrastructure available during their stay at NITKKR.  There are a number of unique opportunities for students to participate in research and make a meaningful contribution to the academia of different disciplines. For example, Undergraduate students involve in research oriented “mini projects” which are part of their regular courses in the curriculum, and also in the “major / final year project work” in their fourth year of study.  Most of the time, interestingly, these kinds of work result very good publications which are very much required for the students towards their higher studies.</div>
